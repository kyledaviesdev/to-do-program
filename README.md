# Overview

This Program is made up of HTML, Javascript, CSS and Uses a bit of JSON.

The Purpose for this is to show off some of my skills with Javascript as well as provide a nice way for me (and others) to keep track of future projects.

Here is a link to my demonstration of the program and how it works.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to help code this project and used this Github repository in conjuction with Github pages to verify that the program works as intended. 

I also used Stack overflow in learning how to make my save and load buttons work by saving the directory of to-do items into a JSON file.

# Future Work

- Add a calander function that allows you to set timed tasks that have a specified end date.
- Make it more stylistically pleasing as it looks a bit bare bones.
- Make it so that it can also add those timed tasks to your computers downloaded calander.
